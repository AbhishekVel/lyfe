   ```

   - The app will automatically detect and display these images

## Running the Application

**Start the application:**
```bash
npm start
```

**For development (with auto-reload):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. **Launch the app** using `npm start`

## Customization

The photo directory is currently hardcoded to `~/Desktop/local_photos`. To change this:

1. Open `src/main.js`
2. Find the line: `const photosPath = path.join(os.homedir(), 'Desktop', 'local_photos');`
3. Change the path to your desired directory

## Troubleshooting

**No photos showing up?**
- Make sure the `~/Desktop/local_photos` directory exists
- Check that you have image files in the directory
- Verify the files have supported extensions
- Try clicking the refresh button

**App won't start?**
- Make sure you've run `npm install`
- Check that you have Node.js installed (`node --version`)
- Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again

## Development

The app structure:
- `src/main.js` - Main Electron process
- `src/index.html` - UI layout
- `src/styles.css` - Styling
- `src/renderer.js` - Frontend logic
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

To modify the app, edit the files in the `src/` directory and restart the application.
